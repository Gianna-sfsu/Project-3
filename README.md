# Project-3
# title: Count On Me 

# Project Overview

This project is about community and how it’s built on trust, kindness, and being there for one another. The song "Count on Me" by Bruno Mars inspired me because it’s a great reminder of these values. My little brother is learning this song in school, and it's been so heartwarming to watch him sing about sticking together. It shows how kids learn early about helping others, and it reminds me how important community is in everyday life.

I want this project to capture that feeling of support and belonging, where people know they can count on each other.

# Technical Overview

This project uses HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to create a fun and interactive website.

- **HTML** is used for the structure of the pages.
- **CSS** is used for styling, like changing the fonts and adding animations.
- The site includes **bounce and glow animations** to make the lyrics stand out when you hover over them.
- **Google Fonts** are used to give the text a playful and fun look.

# Animations:

The animations, like the bouncing and glowing text, were made using **CSS**.

- The **bounce effect** happens when you hover over the "Ooh-ooh-ooh" text. I learned how to do this using a guide from **MDN Web Docs**.
  
- The **glow effect** was made using **text-shadow** in CSS. I got the idea from a tutorial on **CSS-Tricks** that shows how to make glowing text.
